# Game Of Life

## What is Game Of Life?

Conway's Game Of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

## About the Project

This project was created during my education in Codecool in third module of four, focused on Objected Oriented Programming in Java.
The goal was to:

  *practice OOP concept in Java
  *practice MVC (Model, View, Controller) design pattern in a desktop application
  *create a game loop (To do this, I used threads) with the option to pause and change the speed
  *use JavaFx as a GUI
  
The game starts with a blank board filled with little black squares. It allows the user to set up the initial state by clicking on squares and turning them pink, thereby activating them. The game has a pause option, and an option to change its speed.
